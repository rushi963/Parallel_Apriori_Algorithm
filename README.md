# Parallelization of Apriori Algorithm

This project uses concepts related to Parallel Programming, High-Performance Computing and Data Mining. Apriori is a classic algorithm for learning association rules. The apriori algorithm generates frequent item-sets which have frequency greater than the specified support count. Usage of various OpenMP directives in C++ for implementation. It was run on a HPC cluster having 16 cores. The main goal is to achieve maximum speedup by maintaining efficiency.
